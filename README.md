# SKC1-TS
Repository for my solution to the Software Development I Knowledge Check 1.

## Solution Overview
- Set functionality of the Multiply method in Calculator class.
- Abstracted and refactored a static method for printing "not an int" errors in the main switch statement.
- Abstracted and refactored a static method to prompt users for 2 integers.
- Abstracted and refactored a static tuple method for returning 2 user-input factors from `Console.ReadLine()`.
- Having set members to static, it becomes unnecessary to instantiate the calculator class; this was removed from the code. (Better/worse?)

## Further Ideas
- Refactor the calculator class using a 'Result' object constructor.  Construct the Result object passing in two ints as parameters, then call the object properties associated with add, subtract, multiply, divide.  This could reduce code amount.

## Follow-Ups
- Further exploration of tuples.
- Experiment with flushing out further ideas.
